bugs:
  - top button container / card count reloads after additions / deletions still buggy
  - add / delete / rename decks still buggy (sometimes ?!?!?)
  - ALL jquery LOADs are buggy...

todo:
  - refactor / organize global variables and functions
  - validate all input using Joi
  - escape HTML

ideas to do:
  - progress bar / gameify
    - how many correct in a row
    - on fire
  - deck sharing / user profiles
  - verbatim mode
