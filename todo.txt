bugs:
  - top button container / card count reloads after additions / deletions still buggy
  - add / delete / rename decks still buggy (sometimes ?!?!?)

todo:
  - refactor / organize global variables and functions
  - validate front and back input when adding cards
  - validate all input using Joi
  - escape HTML
