- a deck is added
- all options are included by default
- toolbar settings page is selected
  - a copy of the array stored in the database is made and stored in a new variable
    - this happens in the set toolbarOptionsCopy function
  - all checkboxes are matched back to the settings in the database and are selected (checked)
  - the toolbar options in the database are looped through and added to the quill editor
  - when a checkbox is selected
    - if it is in the DOM, it is removed from the DOM AND from the COPY of the toolbar options array
    - if is it NOT in the DOM, it is added to the quill editor and it is added to the COPY of the toolbarOptions array

  - when selecting and removing is happening, it will either be updated via XHR or via a submit button click


- what needs to be solved:
  - how to deal with object options / select options in the toolbar settings and how they correspond to input values in the DOM


- object options: ex. { header: 1 }
  - in the initialzeCheckboxes function
    - if option is obj
      - initialize a sting
      - build a string like 'header:1' out of the object
      - check if the DOM values array has that string
      - if it does, set checked to true
